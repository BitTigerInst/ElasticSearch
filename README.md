### How to sync with github
For first time

1. add source remote to your local git (git remote add source git@github.com:BitTigerInst/ElasticSearch.git)
2. in your console, git checkout master (your branch will become your local/master)
3. git pull source master (merge source/master into local/master)
4. now your local/master (i.e. [master] is updated)
4.1 Often, there will be merge conflict (and console will which file, which line has merge conflict -> fix it in your editor)
4.2 Then git add, git commit, git push and make another pull request
5. Now you can work on new feature, e.g. git checkout -b new_feature123

Later
1. On your local working branch (i.e. [new_feature123]), git pull source master
