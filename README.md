# Introduction

General purpose search engines, as well as search functions within web sites are key to making navigation easy for users. This project will provide students with a chance to practice: building a web app with a third-party API, using an open-source search engine to build your own search feature, and building a user friendly interface for both search inputs and outputs.

This project will introduce several key skill sets needed when taking on real world challenges including: taking advantage of the power of open-source software and third-party APIs (e.g., Twitter API, Google API, Yelp API), front-end coding in Javascript, and deployment of an app to cloud infrastructure. As demand increases for full stack engineers, every software engineers should expand their skill sets into both the front and back end. This project provides a chance to practice both sides.

In this project, we challenge you to use the Twitter API[1] and ElasticSearch[2] to create a Twitter search feature based on geolocation. Your implementation should be able to stream Tweets real-time from Twitter and index/store those tweets into ElasticSearch. The web application should have a good interface for users to enter search information. Finally, this app needs to be deployed on a cloud-platform.
